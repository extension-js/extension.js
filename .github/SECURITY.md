## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in Extension.js, we encourage you to report it right away.

We will investigate all legitimate reports and work quickly to fix the problem.

Our preferred method is to use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting feature. To disclose a potential security issue:

1. Go to the [Security tab](../../security/advisories) of this repository.
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Provide as much detail as possible, including reproduction steps or a proof-of-concept if applicable.

Please avoid filing public issues for security-related matters.

Thank you for helping keep Extension.js safe for everyone.
