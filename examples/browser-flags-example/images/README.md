# Icon Placeholders

In a real extension, you would place your icon files here:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For this example, we're just including this README to demonstrate the file structure.

When creating a PR to extension.js, you would want to include actual icon files that match the extension's theme.
